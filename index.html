    <p>I am priyanshu saha, 1st year student. right now our 1st sem is about to end but within very less amount of time our department developed so much although we get less time but our all faculty member doing very hard work to develop farms, even our VC sir have a great interest in our department so we get so many help from him side. i am sure that the speed we are with we are able to feel the upcoming next batch in 2024 that they have joined a university having agriculture department for years. upcoming juniors are not going to feel any kind of lackness i am assuring this as a CUSBian.</p><br>
